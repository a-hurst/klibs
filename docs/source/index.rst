===================================


.. note:: The documentation is currently very much a work in progress. Several parts of the API have outdated or incomplete documentation, and others lack documentation altogether. Additional guides and documentation can be found in the `klibs wiki <https://github.com/a-hurst/klibs/wiki>`_.
