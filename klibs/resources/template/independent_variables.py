""" ##### FactorSet Tutorial #####

This file specifies the different trial factors and their levels for the experiment.

For example, a spatial cueing task (where participants are cued to respond to targets
on the left or right side of the screen) might have the following factors that change
from trial to trial:

  1) The validity of the spatial cue (same or different location from target)
  2) The location of the spatial cue (left or right of screen)
  3) The onset delay between the cue and target (200, 400, or 800 ms)
  4) The presence of an auditory alerting tone (present or absent)

In addition to the above, let's say you want cues to be valid 66% of the time. To 
specify this sort of factor structure, you can do something like this:

exp_factors = FactorSet({
    'cue_validity': ['valid', 'valid', 'invalid'],
    'cue_location': ['left', 'right'],
    'target_onset': [200, 400, 800],
    'alerting_tone': [True, False],
})

When the experiment is launched, the FactorSet will be loaded by the klibs runtime and
used to generate trials based on the full set of unique combinations of factors.

Specifically, the klibs runtime creates an attribute corresponding to each factor in the
set within the Experiment (e.g. `self.cue_validity`, `self.target_onset`), and updates
their values with their generated per-trial values on each trial. During `self.trial`
and `self.trial_prep` you can use these values to write dynamic code based on the
factors defined in your FactorSet:

    self.trial_prep(self):
        # Determine cue and target locations for the trial
        valid_cue = self.cue_validity == "valid"
        if self.cue_location == "left":
            self.cue_loc = self.left_loc
            self.target_loc = self.left_loc if valid_cue else self.right_loc
        else:
            self.cue_loc = self.right_loc
            self.target_loc = self.right_loc if valid_cue else self.left_loc
